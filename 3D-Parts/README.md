This folder contains all the 3D printable parts. 

The arm sections have 2 versions of each.  The "thick" version has a larger cross-section and is more rigid regarding bending and twisting.  However, on my printer it did not print FLAT.  The warp resulted in a strong, but unusable arm section.  If you can get it to print flat, then it should be the superiod design.

The third arm section, the "pointer" is in two versions as well.  The pretty, curved one is hard to hold, my fingers slip on the curves.  The second one is more like a pencil and easier to hold, though it is less rigid.  Both versions have a hole in the tip to accept a small wire brad nail.  I used a nail that is 0.069" in diameter (1.75mm).  It should have exactly 10mm protrusion beyond the plastic pointer tip for both versions.

The base is designed to be toroidal.  The inside of the torus is intended to hold a heavy powder or granular substance.  I used lead shot because I had it on hand and it is quite heavy.  Filled, the base weighs about 2.3kg (11.3g/cc).  If filled with sand, it would likely weigh only about 0.3kg (1.6g/cc), which is probably not enough.  Fine aluminum granules would be heavier than sand (2.7g/cc or more depending on the alloy).  Brass has a density of 8.53g/cc.  Probably the cheapest per kilo is lead, and it is NOT cheap!  When I bought that lead a couple of decades ago, I do not recall it being particularly expensive at all!

The shape is toroidal which allows the encoder to be serviced wouthout emptying the base of its contents.

The shoulder is extra reinforced to improve its flexural strength.  It has a 60mm base to limit tipping of the whole arm on the encoder bearing's play.  

Where possible a hole is provided for drilling/tapping for a set screw.  The  hole to accept the encoder axle is tuned to the "squish" of my printer.  The axle is nominally 6mm diameter.  I bore out the holes in the arm sections with a 6mm drill to achieve a finger-tight friction fit.
