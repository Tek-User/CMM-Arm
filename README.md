# CMM-Arm
Development of an accurate, inexpensive DIY CMM arm

This projet uses, as much as possible, 3D printed parts.  However, the rigidity of plastic arm sections is sub-optimal, and hollow section aluminum arm segments with 3D printed connectors may be required for good accuracy.

Issues:
I have printed larger cross section arm segments.  THese are, indeed, much more rigid.  But I found that the resulting arm segment has a curvature.  Oddly, it is concave TOWARD the printer bed.  I am not sure WHY this is occurring, so I have not found a solution.  Narrower cross section parts appear to have little or no curvature.

This project is definitely "In Progess", but it is functional now.  It has about +/-1mm reproducibility with the arm segments in different positions, and with the pointer tip in the same XYZ location.
